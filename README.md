# RedPandas

This repository contains routines to streamline preprocessing of [RedVox API 900](https://bitbucket.org/redvoxhi/redvox-protobuf-api/src/master/) 
and [API 1000](https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-api-1000) (API M) data.
The RedVox Pandas (also known as RedPandas) pipeline is designed for integrability with other legacy and heterogeneous data
